									<h1>"Heritage Counts" Publication Automation<br />
									- Historic England</h1>
									<p>At Historic England, as part of the high-priority data collection for a major<br />
									annual publication; “Heritage Counts”, I identified and automated key processes<br />
									using Python, leading to significant efficiency gains.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/cemrecan_yurtman_unsplash_welder.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>The process was originally performed manually, involving numerous repetitive tasks such as creating tables, sending data requests, and handling various formats of data inputs. By implementing automation, I was able to streamline the process, saving considerable amounts of time and reducing the potential for human error.</p>
								<p><b>The updated datasets for Heritage Counts can be seen here: <a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/research/heritage-counts/indicator-data/">@ Heritage Counts Indicator Data.</a></b><br />
								<p><b>Challenges</b><br />
								Prior to automation, the annual data collection process involved:<br />
								• Manually manipulating approximately 200 tables of diverse data sources to accommodate new data.<br />
								• Sending these tables via email to relevant contacts as formal data requests.<br />
								• Downloading data from various sources (including published data and emailed responses) and inputting them into the newly created tables.<br />
								• Managing communication and tracking responses from multiple stakeholders.</p>
								<p>This labour-intensive process was both time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies, given the high volume of data and the need for precise formatting across different tables. The manual approach made it difficult to maintain a streamlined workflow, especially given the number of tables, increasing workload and stakeholders involved.</p>
								<p><b>Automation Approach</b><br />
								To address these challenges, I used Python to automate the following critical aspects:<br />
								<b>1. Table Generation:</b><br />
								I developed a Python script that automatically generates new tables for the upcoming year's data collection, based on predefined formats and the previous year's templates. The script handles approximately 200 tables at once, ensuring consistency in structure and reducing the margin for error.<br />
								<b>2. Email Automation:</b><br />
								I integrated an email automation component, which uses Python libraries such as smtplib to send data requests to the relevant contacts automatically. This included attaching the newly generated tables and personalising emails for each recipient, reducing the need for manual outreach.<br />
								<b>3. Dynamic Data Request:</b><br />
								Each year, the data collection requirements can change slightly. I made the automation flexible to adapt to these changes by allowing easy updates to the table creation logic and email templates, which ensures that any modifications in the data collection process are efficiently accommodated without manual intervention.</p>
								<p><b>Impact and Results</b><br />
								• <b>Efficiency Gains:</b> The automation saved countless hours of administrative work, as the most labour-intensive aspects of the process—table creation and email communication—were handled entirely by the Python script.<br />
								• <b>Error Reduction:</b> Automated table generation and consistent data request formatting minimised human error, improving the accuracy of the data collection process.<br />
								• <b>Scalability:</b> The process is now scalable to accommodate any future increase in the number of data tables or stakeholders without adding administrative burden.<br />
								• <b>Flexibility:</b> Although not all parts of the process can be fully automated (due to variability in data formats and collection methods each year), this approach has proven adaptable enough to streamline the majority of repetitive tasks.</p>
								<p><b>Technologies Used</b><br />
								• <b>Python:</b> Core programming language used for automation.<br />
								• <b>Library - Pandas:</b> For handling data and generating tables programmatically.<br />
								• <b>Library - smtplib:</b> For automating email communication and sending data requests.<br />
								• <b>Library - OS/Filesystem Libraries:</b> For dynamically managing the creation and storage of data tables.</p>
								<p>This automation project not only reduced the administrative burden of data collection but also allowed the team to focus on more strategic tasks, such as data analysis and interpretation, improving overall efficiency and ensuring that deadlines for the annual publication were met without issue.</p>
